          <div class="box-pro">
            <p>
              I am a junior at Rutgers University–Newark, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Mathematics. 
              <br>I play for the Rutgers men’s soccer team and am actively involved in ColorStack and Break Through Tech AI, which are two programs that support diversity 
              in tech and provide hands-on experience and mentorship. I am interested in both backend development and data science. I enjoy learning new 
              technologies and building meaningful projects with them.

            <p> 
              I am passionate about using technology to solve real problems and enjoy building things that are both useful and meaningful. 
              <br>Being a student-athlete has taught me how to manage my time, work collaboratively, and stay consistent under pressure,
              all of which help me grow as a developer and as a student.
